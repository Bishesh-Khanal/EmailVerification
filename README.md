# EmailVerification

I implemented a comprehensive email verification system that fully addresses the asked requirements. When a user registers via the /register endpoint in auth.js, the system generates a secure 32-byte cryptographic token using crypto.randomBytes(), stores it in the database with a 24-hour expiration time, and sends a verification email containing a clickable link to the user's email address using the sendVerificationEmail function from email.js (which uses Nodemailer with proper SMTP configuration). The verification flow is completed through the /verify endpoint that validates the token from the email link, checks for expiration, and updates the user's verification status in the database while clearing the temporary token: ensuring both security through time-limited tokens and a smooth user experience where users can successfully verify their accounts by clicking the emailed link.
